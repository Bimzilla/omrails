				THis is a picture of a rubberized cable wrap. It's incredible, and one of my favorite little items, as I use it to neatly organize all of my electronic cables (iPhone cable, 30-pin connector, micro-USB, etc) in a simple and effective method. Previously, I had used binder clips to organize my cables, but they proved to be cumbersome. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The rubberized cables are the only way to go.

		<div class="span6">
			<h2>My Gaps</h2>
			<p>	
				Below is a list of items for which I have identified a gap:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I often forget to press my French Press, and my coffee goes cold.</li>
				<li>My hands are often full when trying to unlock the front door</li>
				<li>I often miss calls, as I try to unravel the wire disaster around my phone.</li>
				<li>There isn't a good way to keep a pen with my Moleskin</li>
				<li>I always burn through my batteries on my wireless keyboard, but dont have a battery charger</li>
				<li>No good way to indicate if a conference room's phone is in use for a meeting</li>
				<li>It's hard to know how big my browser is when making responsive websites.</li>
				<li>There's no good way to listen to music on my bike.</li>
				<li>I'm often too tired to get up and turn off the ligths when i go to bed</li>
				<li>I need a slimmer way to carry and transport electronics cables</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>My  Design Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				Music while Biking: This fits the categories, as biking to work is a frequent mdoe of trasnportation for me, and catching up on podcasts is important to me. Wearing headphones while riding is dangerous, and prevents the rider from being aware of the surroundings, so an alternative must be found. In a small town like Blacksburg, there are many others who ride bikes in to work that also enjoy lsitening to music. Creating  something to attach my Jambox to my bike should not be tremendously difficult. I am not sure if the final solution is wood, metal, plastic, etc., but am curiosu to see what works.
