<!-- FURTHER REFINEMENT -->


<div class="row-fluid span12">
	<h2>Further Refinement</h2>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid span12">
	<p>
		This project was particularly useful to me, as I frequently work in a design capability for work. While my field of design is more digitally focused, several of the design elements (5 whys/2 hows, brainstorming, design refinement, alpha/beta prototypes, technical drawings, sketches, etc.) have all immediately proved immensely useful in the workplace. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For this project specifically, I had trouble locating quality materials with which i could build the prototype. I initially began with cardboard, which was flimsy from a structural perspective. THis time, I switched to plexiglass, which was challenging on many fronts:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The materials was very difficult to cut
		<li>Achieving straight cuts has been very difficult, as deep cuts were made, then the material needed to be snapped
		<li>Aesthetic details were very difficult to implement		
	</ul>
	<p>
		For the next phase, I'd ideally look to design a #D print, which would create the unibody frame that I'm looking to achieve, while also allowing for deisng niceties that I want.
