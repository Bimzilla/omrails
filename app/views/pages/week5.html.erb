				To test this concept, it attached the prototype to my bike, and began riding. During the ride, I would notice how securely the prototype was attached, how much the Jambox was moving during the ride, and the ease of use to adjust volume and playback while riding.
				<br><br>
				Immediately, some areas were of  concern. As this product is for myself -- and not necessarily a broad user base -- purchase intent wasn't as relevant.
				<br><br>
				However, when comparing the utility of each of the models, it became immediately apparent that small sidewalls could be an enormously effect way of containing the jam box (as reflected in the above concept). Other options, including The Wrestler and The Elastic were viable options for securing the Jambox, but each came with their own issues. The final design, the Open back, had structural weaknesses, but this was mostly due to the material of the prototype (cardboard), rather than a design flaw.
				<br><br>
				Overall, through testing, I've found that this product would be most effective by minimizing the number of materials needed to make it. Ideally, it would be a single piece of material, with nothing needed to be added, no elastic, no straps, snaps, etc. A solid, single piece of material retains a level of beauty (think about the aluminum frame MacBook vs the plastic Macbook of the early-200s), while retaining the functional utility as expressed through the other deign options.
