#BIMSCHLEGER DOTCOM

This is my personal website project. Learning to code by taking the [One Month Rails](http://onemonthrails.com) class, and then trying out some new techniques, I've come up with this site.

##RAILS

Downloaded Rails 3.x, which is what I learned on.

##BOOTSTRAP

Starting on Bootstrap 2.3, I've recently upgraded to Bootstrap 3.0.

##JAVASCRIPT

I'm still learning it...hang tight.
